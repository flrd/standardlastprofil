}
\value{
A data.frame with four variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{profile_id}, character, load profile identifier
\item \code{start_time}, POSIXct / POSIXlt, start time
\item \code{end_time}, POSIXct / POSIXlt, end time
\item \code{watts}, numeric, electric power
}

\description{
Generate a standard load profile, normalized to an annual
consumption of 1,000 kWh
}
\details{
In regards to the electricity market in Germany, the term "Standard Load
Profile" refers to a representative pattern of electricity consumption over
a specific period, based on average consumption data. These profiles are used
to depict the expected electricity consumption for various customer groups,
such as households or businesses.

For every day there are 96 x 1/4h measurements of electrical power for
each combination of \code{profile_id}, \code{period} and \code{day}. Values are normalized
so that they correspond to an annual consumption of 1,000 kWh. So if we sum up all the quarter-hourly
consumption values for one year, the result is (approximately) 1,000 kWh/a,
see 'Examples' and call \code{vignette("algorithm-step-by-step")} for more information.

In total there are 11 representative, standard load profiles for 3 different
customer groups:
\itemize{
\item households: \code{H0}
\item commercial: \code{G0}, \code{G1}, \code{G2}, \code{G3}, \code{G4}, \code{G5}, \code{G6}
\item agriculture: \code{L0}, \code{L1}, \code{L2}
}

Call \code{\link[=slp_info]{slp_info()}} to for more information and examples.

Definition of periods:
\itemize{
\item \code{summer}: May 15 to September 14
\item \code{winter}: November 1 to March 20
\item \code{transition}: March 21 to May 14, and September 15 to October 31
}

Definition of characteristic days:
\itemize{
\item \code{saturday}: Saturdays; Dec 24th and Dec 31th are considered a Saturday too,
if they are not a Sunday
\item \code{sunday}: Sundays and all public holidays
\item \code{workday}: Monday to Friday
}

\strong{Note}: The package supports nationwide, public holidays for Germany. Those
were retrieved from the \href{https://github.com/nager/Nager.Date}{nager.Date API}.
Use the optional argument \code{state_code} to consider public holidays on a state
level too. Possible values are:
\itemize{
\item \code{DE-BB}: Brandenburg
\item \code{DE-BE}: Berlin
\item \code{DE-BW}: Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg
\item \code{DE-BY}: Bavaria
\item \code{DE-HB}: Bremen
\item \code{DE-HE}: Hesse
\item \code{DE-HH}: Hamburg
\item \code{DE-MV}: Mecklenburg-Vorpommern
\item \code{DE-NI}: Lower-Saxony
\item \code{DE-NW}: North Rhine-Westphalia
\item \code{DE-RP}: Rhineland-Palatinate
\item \code{DE-SH}: Schleswig-Holstein
\item \code{DE-SL}: Saarland
\item \code{DE-SN}: Saxony
\item \code{DE-ST}: Saxony-Anhalt
\item \code{DE-TH}: Thuringia
}

The dataset \code{german_states} contains all 16 state codes and their respective names in German and English.

\code{start_date} must be greater or equal to "1990-01-01". This is because public holidays in Germany would
be ambitious before the reunification in 1990 (think of the state of Berlin in
1989)

\code{end_date} must be smaller or equal to "2073-12-31" because this is highest
year supported by the \href{https://github.com/nager/Nager.Date}{nager.Date API}.

# you can supply one of 16 ISO 3166-2:DE state codes for each German state
\dontrun{
slp_generate("H0", "2024-01-01", "2024-12-31", state = "DE-BE")

# with or without "DE-" prefix, case-insensitive
slp_generate("H0", "2024-01-01", "2024-12-31", state = "BE")
slp_generate("H0", "2024-01-01", "2024-12-31", state_code = "de-be") # all Berlin

# if no state code is provided then only nationwide public holidays are considered
slp_generate("H0", "2024-01-01", "2024-12-31")
