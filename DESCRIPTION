Title: R data package for load profiles for electricity
Description: A load profile describes the consumption profile of an electricity 
  consumer over a certain period of time. For electricity customers without modern 
  meter devices, an energy utility uses standardised load profiles (SLP). These
  SLPs replace the non-existent load profile of end consumers with a calculated,
  sufficiently accurate forecast of electricity consumption on a 15-minutes basis.
  This packages provides data from the German Association of Energy and Water 
  Industries (BDEW Bundesverband der Energie- und Wasserwirtschaft e.V.) in a tidy
  format. For each of the eleven profiles, 96 quarter-hourly values are included
  for three different days of the week - workday, Saturday, Sunday - and
  three different seasons - summer, winter, transition -, i.e. a total of
  3x3x96 observations per profile.
