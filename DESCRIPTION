Title: R data package for load profiles for electricity
Description: This package provides data on standardized load profiles from
  the German Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW Bundesverband
  der Energie- und Wasserwirtschaft e.V.) in a tidy format. The data was
  published in 1999 and since then has formed a basis for energy suppliers
  to approximate the estimated electricity consumption for their customers.
  A standardized load profile describes the consumption profile of an energy 
  consumer over a certain period of time. The package also provides an interface
  to generate a load profile over a user specified period of time.
