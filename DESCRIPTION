Title: Generate load profiles for electricity
Description: For electricity customers without advanced metering infrastructure, 
  an energy supplier uses standardised load profiles (SLP). These SLPs replace
  the non-existent load profile of end consumers with a calculated, sufficiently 
  accurate forecast of electricity consumption on a 15-minutes basis. 
  This packages provides the the German Association of Energy and Water Industries
  (BDEW Bundesverband der Energie- und Wasserwirtschaft e.V.) in a tidy format.
  The data contains standardized load profiles for three customer groups -- 
  household, agriculture and commercial customers. A distinction is also made 
  between weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays and between summer, winter and 
  a transitional period.
