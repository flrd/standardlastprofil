Title: Generate load profiles for electricity
Description: For electricity customers without recording power measurement, 
  the energy supplier uses standard load profiles (SLP). These SLPs replace
  the non-existent load profile of end consumers with a calculated, sufficiently 
  accurate forecast of electricity consumption on a quarter-hourly basis. SLPs 
  are representativeload profiles that are used for the different customer 
  groups (household, agriculture and commerce), each of which is assumed to 
  have similar consumption behaviour.
  The data is taken from the German Association of Energy and Water Industries
  (BDEW Bundesverband der Energie- und Wasserwirtschaft e.V.).
